# Contact List App
This project was designed to introduce us to the concept of global state - storing all our app's variables and functions in one central location, where they can be accessed from anywhere within our app. For this project we used the technology [flux](https://medium.com/@er.rameshkatiyar/know-the-flux-and-redux-f157f8e83bb1) in order to do this. 

This project ended up being a lot more challenging than I initially imagined, but this is also a result of going above what I was asked to do. For example, using modals in order to edit and delete contacts on the list of contacts page, or making a big effort to make the design and feel of the app nice. 

The project can be seen below or at the [live version](https://4-geeks-contact-list-app.vercel.app/)
